## Something meaningless

A puzzle game. For web. Written in TypeScript. Made with WebGL, WebAudio and other standard APIs. Whee.

### Building

Open terminal and type `make js_full` (or `make` or `make js` will compile in the watch mode, which is good for development). Running `make dist` puts everything in a zip folder. `make server` will just start a python3 http server for running the application.

### License

The license for the code is... (throws a die), *LGPL v3.0*. 

The theme music file "assets/audio/theme.ogg" is NOT for public use, and in the case you, for some reason, want to modify this game and publish it (which I don't encourage, but I cannot stop you, can I?) you have to replace (or do not use at all) the music file.
